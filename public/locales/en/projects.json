    "header": "Sun Tracking System",
    "content": "300W 24V DC Motor can control direction and speed. Thanks to the IMU on it, it can measure its own angle independent of external sensors. Magnetic Induction angle sensor can be attached. There is an external incliometer input. 2 Limit sensors can be attached. There is a temperature sensor. There is a temperature sensor at the desired angle in a closed loop. It can fix its position. It can respond to information requests such as real-time angle, temperature, motor speed, direction. It can communicate easily over long distances (~1200m) using RS 485 Hardware infrastructure. It can easily use many devices simultaneously thanks to MODBUS RTU Software protocol. Box with IP Protection It can work in adverse weather conditions for many years with its liquid-proof special coated sockets. It has a structure that does not suffer from corrosion. Thanks to its modular structure, it is easy to change and adapt in case of malfunction or project changes. Can be used with repeaters 256 Devices can be addressed on the same cabling. Thanks to the internal power supply, it works by connecting directly to the mains. Thanks to the 3 status LEDs on it, operating status notifications can be received. "

    "header": "Digital Flow Simulation",
    "content": "Digital flow simulation is the process of using computer software to model and analyze the movement of gases when they encounter obstacles in a system or environment. This can be used to predict how these substances will behave under different conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and flow rate, and can be used to optimize the design and performance of a variety of systems, including pipes, engines, aircraft, and more. Flow simulation is a highly complex and specialized field that requires a thorough understanding of fluid dynamics, mathematics, and computer modeling, and this simulation allows for an interactive learning process."

    "header": "Pipe Quality Control System",
    "content": "The pipe quality control system uses image processing techniques to perform quality control during the flexible pipe production process. Specifically designed and developed for Kayalar Press, this system aims to minimize production errors in pipe production. When the system detects that the quality has fallen below acceptable limits during the production process, it automatically stops the production line and sends information about the error to the FTP server. This allows errors and problems that may arise during the production process to be detected and the production stopped automatically, increasing production efficiency."
